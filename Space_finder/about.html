        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Spacefinder was founded in 2022 by a group of avid students who shared a common problem of finding accommodation around campus. Frustrated by the limited options and lack of transparency in the hostel booking industry, they set out on a mission to revolutionise the way people discover and book hostels.
            <br><br><br>
            Starting as a small startup, we quickly gained momentum by partnering with hostels in various destinations, focusing on providing students with a one-stop platform to find affordable, comfortable, and exciting accommodations. Our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction helped us grow exponentially.
            <br><br><br>
            Over the years, we've evolved into a trusted and globally recognized brand, serving students from all corners of the globe. Our journey has been marked by innovation, dedication, and the relentless pursuit of providing students with unforgettable experiences.</p>
